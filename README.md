# comparison_pattern_recognition_methods

These Program utilizes Mnist dataset to compare the baseline performances of my implementation of the standard techinques:

1) Bayes Classification
2) Nearest neighbor Classification
3) SVM
4) CNN

It also provides and option to use Prinicpal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis for dimensionality reduction. The performance with dimensionality reduction is comparable to  the latter but the computational time is reduced by a large amount.

Run the corresponding code in the following manner
```
python scripts/bayes_classifier.py
```
